## TensorFlow
In this Project well be using TensorFlow to program and train our own accurately built neural network. TensorFlow is a library developed by Google with the soul purpose of accelerating and simplifying the process of building and training machine learning models. As you might have seen in the previous project, [Building a Neuron in Python](https://patchyst.github.io/My_First_Machine_Learning_Model/), creating even a single neuron can be a bothersome and complicated task for a beginner. However, libraries such as TensorFlow facilitate the process giving you more room to build more complex models, you'll see why here in a second.
