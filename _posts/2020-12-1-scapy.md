excerpt: "Use Scapy to easily create a packet and capture it with WireShark"
---
 Scapy, originally developed in Python by Philippe Biondi, is a tool that allows users to easily create and manipulate a network packet. For this project I'll demonstrate how to create a simple packet with a string payload and send it to a selected IP or MAC address. I'll break down the code and demonstrate how to find your packet in WireShark.

# Installation
 Scapy works best with Unix based systems, but newer versions can be run on Windows. If you're using a programming oriented Virtual Machine such as Kali Linux or Red Hat Linux, it's likely scapy is preinstalled. Type "scapy" into cmd/terminal to check. If the Scapy Interface doesn't appear it can be installed in the following ways:
### **Mac and Windows**
#### *best way*

(replace "basic" with "complete" to get Scapy + extensions)
```python
pip install --pre scapy[basic]
```
*GitHub install*
```python
git clone https://github.com/secdev/scapy.git
```
### **linux and Mac with Brew**

```python
wget https://github.com/secdev/scapy/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd master
```
