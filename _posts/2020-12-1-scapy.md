 Scapy, originally developed in Python by Philippe Biondi, is a tool that allows users to easily create and manipulate a network packet. For this project I'll demonstrate how to create a simple packet with a string payload and send it to a selected IP or MAC address. I'll break down the code and demonstrate how to find your packet in WireShark.

# Installation
 Scapy works best with Unix based systems, but newer versions can be run on Windows. If you're using a programming oriented Virtual Machine such as Kali Linux or Red Hat Linux, it's likely scapy is preinstalled. Type "scapy" into cmd/terminal to check. If the Scapy Interface doesn't appear it can be installed in the following ways:
### **Mac and Windows**
#### *best way*

(replace "basic" with "complete" to get Scapy + extensions)
```python
pip install --pre scapy[basic]
```
*GitHub install*
```python
git clone https://github.com/secdev/scapy.git
```
### **linux and Mac with Brew**

```python
wget https://github.com/secdev/scapy/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd master
```


Type "scapy" into terminal/cmd and you should see the Scapy user interface come up:

To send **one** packet use scapy's send() function:
```python
send()
```
We're going to create an IP packet so we'll use the IP() function. The IP() function's parameters take in the packet's destination:
*An IP address or MAC address can be passed into dst=""*

```python
send(IP(dst="172.20.10.3"))
```
and *optionally* a "source" from which the packet will appear to come from. This lets you spoof the packet source, but you won't receive a response packet as it will go to the spoofed source.
```python
send(IP(dst="172.20.10.3", src="118.244.221.56"))
```
For now I'm not going to use src="" as I want to receive a response packet. Next, specify what network protocol you want to use. I'm going to use TCP protocol, but scapy let's you use a range of network protocols such as ICMP() and UDP().
```python
send(IP(dst="172.20.10.3")/TCP())
```
And finally attach a payload to your packet. To keep things simple I'll attach a string:
```python
send(IP(dst="172.20.10.3")/TCP()/"Hello!")
```
Launch the packet and head over to WireShark.

Now you'll have a number of network interfaces to choose from, but the important ones are
