## Bad USBs:
Computers, printers, external drives, scanners, and cameras, they all have one thing in common, a Universal Serial Bus(USB) socket. conveniently, nearly every one of these devices have no security measures in place to prevent harmful devices from being plugged in, the operating system essentially allows the USB to do whatever it wants because anti-virus software cannot access the software on a USB. A "Bad USB" is a USB drive with the microcontroller's firmware reprogrammed in such a way that allows it to be used for malicious purposes.


## Keyboard Injectors
A Keyboard injector is a Bad USB programmed to initiate keystrokes at superhuman speeds once plugged in.
