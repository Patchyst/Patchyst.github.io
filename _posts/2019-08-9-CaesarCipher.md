# What is a Caeser cipher?
As you've probably guessed it has something to do with Julius Caesar. While the Caesar Cipher probably wasn't invented by Caeser himself, he certainly boosted it's recognition. Whenever Caeser had anything confidential to say he would write in a shift cipher or what we now call the Caeser Cipher. The Caesar Cipher or shift cipher is one of the oldest known ciphers in cryptography. As of now it's pretty much useless with only 26 possible mappings it's vulnerable to even a brute force attack done by hand. However, at a time when most people were illiterate Caeser probably considered his clever little cipher pretty secure. The only issue with a Caeser cipher nowadays is that once someone realizes your using a Caeser Cipher it won't take them long at all to decode your message. In 1883 Auguste Kerkhoff proclaimed in an innovative essay, "The system must not require secrecy and can be stolen by the enemy without causing trouble". At the time I'm sure people thought he was crazy, "How can you make an encryption with so many possibilities that a brute force is impossible?". Well, with the invention of computers we **are** able to make those encryptions, encryptions like the [XOR Stream Cipher](https://patchyst.github.io/XORstream/) or the [Hexadecimal Block Cipher](https://patchyst.github.io/BlockCipher/) are pretty much only broken through human error and social engineering.
