# Encryption Project: XOR Stream Cipher
        In this project I will be guiding you (the reader) through the process of making a secure binary encryption.
  To some binary numbers may seem shrouded in mystery and secrecy, a classified code that only natural born
  geniuses can understand. However, binary numbers can be boiled to two simple values that even someone with
  zero knowledge of computer hardware and software can understand


## What are Binary Numbers? *italics*
    So what is a Binary Number? Well, as I'm sure you've seen before, a 1 or 0, but what does that really
    mean? *italics*
