# Encryption Project: XOR Stream Cipher
  In this project I will be guiding you (the reader) through the process of making a secure binary encryption.
  To some binary numbers may seem shrouded in mystery and secrecy, a classified code that only natural born
  geniuses can understand. However, binary numbers can be boiled to two simple values that even someone with
  zero knowledge of computer hardware and software can understand.


## What are Binary Numbers?
So what is a Binary Number? Well, as I'm sure you've seen before, or guessed by the bi prefix, Binary consists of a 1 or 0, but what does that really *mean?*
A computer, at the most basic level contains a series of on and off switches. 1 representing *on* and 0 representing *off*. You could go a step further and assign
binary numbers to a Boolean value True(1) or False(0). Now lets convert a Binary number to our number system. Unlike the base 10 system Binary uses the base 2 system
